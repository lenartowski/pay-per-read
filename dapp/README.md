# Pay-per-read
## Idea
Idea behind dapp is to create crypto based paywall where user can buy access to individual articles instead of subscription based access.

User can access single article for small one time fee instead of buiyng full month/year subscription.

### PrivatePaywall
*in progress*

Simpler version of paywall. Single publisher is contract owner. User buys access paying to contract's account.

### PublicPaywall
*TODO*

Multiple publisher contract. Everyone use contract as a publisher, when users buy access, money is distributed to publisher with 1% fee to contract owner.
